An attacker can view, add, delete or modify information stored in the database with privileges of the current database user. In case of web application this weakness often leads to a website deface or a database exfiltration.
Insecure configuration of database may allow an attacker to write files into arbitrary locations on the system (e.g. SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE construction in MySQL), which might lead to system compromise.Modern SQL injections are being used to spread malware, they can be leveraged to turn innocent websites into drive-by-download sites, which will serve malware to unsuspecting visitors. | Quote and backslash escaping for strings is the most popular and effective strategy against SQL injection attacks. It should be performed according to requirements of each particular database.Casting operations of digits (e.g. int, float) is usually enough to defend application against SQL injection In certain cases, parameter values should be checked against existing templates and treated according to these templates
