# Incorrect Default Permissions [CWE-276]





# Potential impact

```
this weakness is locally exploitable. A malicious user might be able to gain access to sensitive information, tamper with sensitive data or compromise the vulnerable system entirely.
If a setuid/setgid executable has world writable permissions any local user can inject malicious content into it and execute arbitrary code with privileges of the file's owner.

### SQL Injection [CWE-89]


# Potential impact
```
An attacker can view, add, delete or modify information stored in the database with privileges of the current database user. In case of web application this weakness often leads to a website deface or a database exfiltration.

Insecure configuration of database may allow an attacker to write files into arbitrary locations on the system (e.g. SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE construction in MySQL), which might lead to system compromise.

Modern SQL injections are being used to spread malware, they can be leveraged to turn innocent websites into drive-by-download sites, which will serve malware to unsuspecting visitors.

# Vulnerability Remediation Techniques and Examples
```
Quote and backslash escaping for strings is the most popular and effective strategy against SQL injection attacks. It should be performed according to requirements of each particular database.

Casting operations of digits (e.g. int, float) is usually enough to defend application against SQL injection.

In certain cases, parameter values should be checked against existing templates and treated according to these templates.
